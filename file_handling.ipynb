        "->Compiled language translate the entire program into machine code beforehand, while interpreted language translate and execute code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "->Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors or unexpected situations that occur during program execution. you can achieve this by using try,except,else,finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "->The purpose of finally block is that a specific block of code is executed regardless of exception is thrown or not within the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "->Logging records the state and flow of your code.It is useful for understanding ,monitoring and debugging your code.\n",

        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "->You can handle multiple exception by using multiple except blocks or by catching multiple exception in a single except block using tuple.\n",

        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "->'With' statement is used for resource management. It ensures that file is properly closed after its suits finishes , even if a exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "->Multithreading allows single program to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single process while multiprocessing enables you to create multiple processes each with its own memory space.\n",

        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "->Because files are limited resource managed by operating system ,making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard to debug issues like running out of file or corrupt data.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
